<h1> Sort for Earth </h1>

Did you know that the average person has the opportunity to recycle more than 25,000 cans in his or her lifetime? That recycling a single aluminum can saves enough energy to power a television for three whole hours?

At SORT FOR EARTH, we know that you care about the planet and so do we. That's why we made a nifty-as-heck machine learning tool to help you sort your trash with more ease and accuracy. Follow two easy steps to find out if your trash is considered to be recycling, compost, garbage, or a non-compostable material. Happy sorting, fellow earthlings! ðŸŒ±
